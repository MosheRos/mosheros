    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What is Maaser?</h3>
        <p>Maaser, commonly known as "tithe," is the cherished Jewish tradition of donating 10% of one's earnings to charity. This practice is a fundamental way to support the community and those in need. Some individuals also observe the custom of giving 20% (a "Chomesh") for an even greater impact.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does the iMaaser app help?</h3>
        <p>The iMaaser app is designed to make your charitable giving effortless. It simplifies the process by helping you track your income, accurately calculate your maaser obligation, and seamlessly distribute your donations to the causes you care about. Our platform provides a clear, organized, and transparent way to manage your tzedakah (charity).</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Is this service free?</h3>
        <p>Absolutely. The iMaaser app and web dashboard are completely free to use. Our mission is to make participating in the beautiful mitzvah of Maaser as easy and accessible as possible for everyone.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How can I sign up?</h3>
        <p>Getting started is simple and takes just a few minutes! You can sign up by visiting <strong>app.imaaser.org</strong> or by downloading our mobile app. Just register with your email, connect your bank account, and you're ready to donate. If you need any assistance, our support team is just a phone call away.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How secure is connecting my bank account?</h3>
        <p>Your security is our top priority. We partner with Plaid, a global leader in secure financial technology trusted by major banks and fintech companies worldwide. iMaaser never sees or stores your bank login credentials. We only receive permission to process the donations you authorize.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>What if I prefer not to use Plaid?</h3>
        <p>We understand. If you'd rather not use Plaid, we offer a manual connection option using your bank's routing and account numbers. Please note that this method requires a verification process, so it may take a little longer to set up.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I donate with a credit card?</h3>
        <p>Yes, you can donate via credit card. However, to help us keep the iMaaser platform free for everyone, we encourage using a direct bank connection. Credit card companies charge processing fees, which reduces the amount that goes to charity. Using a bank connection ensures that 100% of your intended donation is available for distribution.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Can I donate without regular internet access?</h3>
        <p>Yes! We've made it possible to donate on the go. Simply send a text message to <strong>718-IMAASER (718-462-2737)</strong> with the organization's unique 4-digit code and the amount you wish to donate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>How does iMaaser work, and are my donations tax-deductible?</h3>
        <p>iMaaser operates as a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit Donor-Advised Fund (DAF). When you donate to your iMaaser account, you are making a contribution to a nonprofit organization, which makes your donation tax-deductible to the full extent of the law. We provide our EIN (87-2258154) for your tax records. You can then advise us to distribute the funds from your account to the charitable organizations of your choice.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
